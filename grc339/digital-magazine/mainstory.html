				<h2>Fashion</h2>

				<p>
					Fashion in the Y2K era wasn’t subtle — it was bold, experimental, and dripping with personality. Think low-rise jeans paired with glittery crop tops, butterfly clips stacked like crowns, and rhinestones carefully glued to flip phones and eyebrows alike. This was the era of maximalism with no apologies — the more shimmer, shine, and logos, the better.
				</p>

				<p>
					The early 2000s fashion landscape was defined by contradictions: futuristic cyber chic one moment, pastel mall-girl aesthetics the next. Brands like Juicy Couture, Baby Phat, and Delia’s gave teens and twenty-somethings an aspirational wardrobe that was equal parts playful and glamorous. Celebrities like Britney Spears, Paris Hilton, and Destiny’s Child weren’t just entertainers — they were style icons who turned velour tracksuits, tinted sunglasses, and bedazzled everything into global trends.
				</p>
					
				<p>
					But Y2K fashion wasn’t just about what we wore — it was about how it made us feel. It was the confidence of strutting through the mall with a Claire’s shopping bag, the excitement of choosing the right sparkly top for a Friday night out, the thrill of dressing like the future was already here. And now, two decades later, those same looks are returning to runways and TikTok feeds, proving that Y2K style never really left — it just went on standby, waiting for its glittery reboot. In this section, we revisit the most iconic looks of the millennium, explore their modern revival, and ask: what does it mean to dress Y2K in the 2020s?
