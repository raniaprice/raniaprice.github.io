            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            
            <h3>Retrograde </h3><!--Change it to the name of the company-->
            
            <p>Retrograde is a digital magazine dedicated to the revival of the Y2K aesthetic, spotlighting the iconic trends of the late 90s and early 2000s that are making a comeback. From butterfly clips and low-rise jeans to rhinestone accessories and velour tracksuits, we explore how these nostalgic styles are being reinterpreted by mainly Gen Z and Millennials today. With a mix of trend reports, style guides, and pop-culture deep-dives, Retrograde bridges the gap between past and present, proving that what was once “out” is officially back “in.” </p><!--Short description of the magazine-->
